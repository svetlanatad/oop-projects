**Problem 1** You are given a sequence of values {−2k,−2(k−1),...,−4,−2,0,2,4,...,2(k−1),2k} in a random order where exactly one value v is missing. The aim of this problem is to find the value of v2.
Write a program that uses a Scanner to read the value k and then 2∗k numbers from the sequence (given in an arbitrary order) and outputs the value of v2.


**Problem 2** Consider a programming language that has one variable, v, and two operations >> and << that divide and multiply the value of v by 2 respectively. Each statement in this language includes exactly one operation and the variable v. The operation sign can be located at either side of the variable.
Write a program, that uses a Scanner to read a natural number n (n ≤ 12) and n lines, each containing one statement, and calculates the final value of v after applying all the operations. The initial value of v is 2. Your program should use minimum number of operations and use as few variables as possible. You are not allowed to perform any value comparisons (except for controlling the basic progress of a potential loop), or use any methods that do any type of comparisons. You can use Math.pow() method.


**Problem 4** Let F be an n × n matrix, consisting of n × n − 1 hyphens (“-”) and a single lonely r that represents a rabbit lost in a field.
/) /)
( • ∧•)
c( ⊃ )⊃
It is possible to swap any two adjacent rows or columns of F as many times as you want.
Write a program that uses Scanner to read natural odd number n, and n lines, each containing n characters (either − or r) separated by a single space (representing F ) and calculates the minimum number of steps needed to move the lonely rabbit to its home– the center of F. The program should execute minimum number of operations. There is exactly one r in the input.



**Problem 4** You are feeling a bit frustrated with Java and its long, complicated identifiers, thus you want to write a program to shorten words. You consider strings with more than 13 characters to be long. You are going to process input words in the following way:
• If the length of the input word is shorter than 14, no change should happen, else
– swap the first and last letters of the word
– replace characters between them with the ternary representation of the number of these
characters (without any leading zeros)
Write a program that takes as an input a single word and outputs its modified version. You are not allowed to use any ready-made methods for the conversion.


**Problem 5** You decide to design an algorithm for strings (consisting of uppercase Latin letters) that works as follows:
• Inserts symbol “!” after each consonant • Replaces all the vowels by symbol “&”
Write a program that takes as an input a single word and outputs its modified version. The word is guaranteed to be non-empty. You should use regular expression(s) when you can.

**Problem 6** Write a program that inputs one positive integer l and draws an “X” shape where each “hand” is of length l. You can use nested loops for printing repeated characters, but you should use a single outer loop for drawing the whole figure.
