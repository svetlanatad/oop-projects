# oop-projects
Coming from the name, you may find all of my OOP projects :)
Except for HW01, each folder is a seperate project I spent about 2 weeks or less on. HW01 includes my starting practice problems with Java.
Each of the folder contains a readme, which is the description of the tasks I was working on. You can make a pdf out of the readme using make.
